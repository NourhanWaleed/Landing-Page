-I was confused atfirst and did the project using only HTML and CSS then I realised that it's supposed to be done using javascript so I watched the webinar and views some sources and I'll list them down here.

-so I've decided to use the shortest and most efficient method to make the navigation bar as well as a return to top button
-This code was quite fun to write except for some small errors,for example,choosing color instead of background color, as well as the id and class confusion

-Atfirst I used an Array as a data structure to store the section numbers but I got confused so I just looped over them and added the list items

-I know the Return to top button looks unclickable but it works just fine
-the smooth scrolling is included in the css file under the html{}
-I know I should've used the setTimeOut to earn some time while scrolling but I prefered to use the shortcut (above point) in the css file
-added to extra sections to test the code and re-test it
